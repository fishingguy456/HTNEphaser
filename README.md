# Neurologue - the game that plays you.

A psychological horror choose-your own-adventure game that follows the player's meeting with a slightly philosophical psychiatrist. Unlike traditional video games, the characters in Neurologue can sense exactly how the player is feeling in real-time. Using an electroencephalographic brain-computer interface, the game reads 7 major physiological metrics that determine the way that characters interact with you, the effect of your choices, and who you are as a player. Whether you are excited, focused, or relaxed, Neurologue makes the story as real as it gets.
